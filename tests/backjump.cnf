c CNF file heavily biased to demonstrate backjumping efficiency
c This problem has very deep forcing chains that lead to conflicts far down the tree
c Backjumping should MASSIVELY outperform chronological backtracking
c 
c Problem structure: Multiple very long chains that conflict only at the deepest levels
c Without backjumping: must explore O(2^n) branches before finding the real culprit
c With backjumping: can skip entire subtrees by jumping to the actual conflict source
